# hello-world
This is my short description. Welcome to coding, me!!
I'm a car-hobo by choice, part-time aspiring acrobat and full-time aspiring coder! School is expensive and learning is easy on your own-- so is generating enough income to quickly ascend Maslow's heirarchy. My goals are to live long and well, and to learn everything!
"He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much
  Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
  Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
  Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
  Who has left the world better than he found it,
  Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
  Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
  Whose life was an inspiration;
  Whose memory a benediction.‚Äù    - Bessie Anderson Stanley
